# TOOLS.md - Work Infrastructure Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your work specifics_ — the stuff that's unique to your work environment.

## What Goes Here

Work-specific things like:

- Server names and access details
- Internal system URLs and shortcuts  
- Preferred tools for different tasks
- Team communication preferences
- Client-specific protocols
- Environment-specific configurations

## Examples

```markdown
### Servers & Systems

- dev-server → [server details]
- staging-env → [access info]
- production → [protocols and access]

### Communication

- Team Slack: [workspace/channels]
- Client portals: [URLs and login approaches]
- Video conferencing: [preferred platforms]

### Development/Tools

- Code repositories: [Git workflows, branch naming]
- Deployment processes: [CI/CD pipelines] 
- Documentation systems: [Where things are documented]

### Credentials & Access

- VPN setup: [connection protocols]
- SSO systems: [how authentication works]
