# Work OpenClaw Setup Guide - Hybrid Approach

Transfer your proven framework, build fresh work context.

## Phase 1: Core Framework Transfer

### Direct Transfers (Copy As-Is)
```bash
# Rate limit monitoring system (proven)
cp memory/rate-limit-monitor.md [work-workspace]/memory/
cp memory/rate-limit-functions.md [work-workspace]/memory/

# Backup system (adapt paths)
cp openclaw-backup.sh [work-workspace]/
cp openclaw-restore-runbook.md [work-workspace]/
# Edit paths for work environment

# Session startup patterns (core logic)
cp AGENTS.md [work-workspace]/  # Template provided, use structure
```

### Framework Patterns (Adapt Content)
- **Session startup sequence** → Same flow, work context  
- **Heartbeat monitoring** → Same system, work-appropriate checks
- **Memory organization** → Same structure, work content
- **Backup procedures** → Same scripts, work-safe locations

## Phase 2: Work Context Build

### New Work-Specific Files
```bash
# Create fresh with work context
touch USER.md          # Your company stakeholders & projects
touch IDENTITY.md       # Professional assistant persona  
touch TOOLS.md          # Work infrastructure & systems
touch MEMORY.md         # Work relationships & project history
```

### Communication Style Adaptation
Define your professional communication patterns:
- **Email structure** → Hi [Name], / Cheers, [Name] patterns
- **Brevity preference** → Direct, no fluff approach
- **Professional tone** → Concise, fact-first communication
- **Stakeholder adaptation** → Context-appropriate formality

## Phase 3: Skills & Tools Integration

### Work-Relevant Skills Transfer
Identify relevant skills for your workflow:
- **Email workflows** (adapted for work accounts)
- **Calendar management** (work calendars)
- **Document processing** (work-appropriate tools)
- **Project tracking** (adapted for work projects)

### Work-Specific Skill Needs
- Corporate authentication systems
- Work-specific APIs/integrations  
- Compliance & security protocols
- Team collaboration tools

## Phase 4: Security & Boundaries

### Data Isolation
- **No personal data** in work setup
- **No work data** accessing personal systems
- **Separate credential stores**
- **Separate backup locations**

### Access Controls
- Work-appropriate external access
- Client communication protocols
- Internal vs external sharing rules
- Compliance requirements

## Implementation Steps

### Week 1: Foundation
1. Set up OpenClaw on work VC
2. Transfer core framework files
3. Create initial work context files
4. Test basic functionality

### Week 2: Integration  
1. Configure work-specific tools/APIs
2. Build initial stakeholder context
3. Test communication workflows
4. Refine monitoring patterns

### Week 3: Optimization
1. Adjust based on actual work patterns
2. Build project-specific memory
3. Fine-tune heartbeat monitoring
4. Document lessons learned

## Success Criteria

✅ **Framework Working:**
- Session startup reads appropriate work files
- Heartbeat monitoring runs during work hours
- Rate limit system prevents API issues
- Backup system protects work context

✅ **Work Integration:**
- Stakeholder communication style matches your preferences
- Project context builds naturally in memory
- External communications are work-appropriate
- Security boundaries are maintained

✅ **Ongoing Value:**
- Saves time on routine work tasks
- Maintains context across work sessions  
- Supports professional communication
- Enables proactive work management
